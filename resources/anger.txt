Introduction to The 'Gnani Purush'
On a June evening in 1958 at around six o’clock, Ambalal
Muljibhai Patel, a family man, a contractor by profession, was
sitting on a bench on the busy platform number 3 of Surat’s
train station. Surat is a city in south Gujarat, a western state in
India. What happened within the next forty-eight minutes was
phenomenal. Spontaneous Self-realization occurred within
Ambalal M. Patel. During this event his ego completely melted
and from that moment onwards he became completely detached
from all Ambalal’s thoughts, speech and acts. He became the
Lord’s living instrument for the salvation of mankind, through
the path of knowledge. He called this Lord, Dada Bhagwan. To
everyone he met, he would say, “This Lord, Dada Bhagwan is
fully manifest within me. He also resides within all living beings.
The difference is that within me He is completely expressed and
in you, he is yet to manifest.”
Who are we? What is God? Who runs this world?
What is karma? What is liberation? Etc. All the world’s spiritual
questions were answered during this event. Thus nature offered
absolute vision to the world through the medium of Shree
Ambalal Muljibhai Patel.
Ambalal was born in Tarsali, a suburb of the city of
Baroda and raised in Bhadran, Gujarat. His wife’s name was
Hiraba. Although he was a contractor by profession, his life at
home and his interaction with everyone around him was exemplary
even prior to his Self-realization. After becoming Self-realized
and attaining the state of a Gnani, (The Awakened One), his
body became a ‘public charitable trust.’
Throughout his whole life he lived by the principle that
there should not be any commerce in religion, and in all
commerce there must be religion. He also never took money

from anyone for his own use. He used the profits from his
business to take his devotees for pilgrimages to various parts of
India.
His words became the foundation for the new, direct and
step-less path to Self-realization called Akram Vignan. Through
his divine original scientific experiment (The Gnan Vidhi), he
imparted this knowledge to others within two hours. Thousands
have received his grace through this process and thousands
continue to do so even now. ‘Akram’ means without steps; an
elevator path or a short cut, whereas ‘Kram’ means an orderly
step-by-step spiritual path. Akram is now recognized as a direct
shortcut to the bliss of the Self.

Who is Dada Bhagwan ?
When he explained to others who ‘Dada Bhagwan’ is, he
would say:
“What you see here is not ‘Dada Bhagwan.’ What you see
is ‘A.M.Patel.’ I am a Gnani Purush and He that is manifest within
me, is ‘Dada Bhagwan’. He is the Lord within. He is within you
and everyone else. He has not yet manifest within you, whereas
within me he is fully manifest. I myself am not a Bhagwan. I too
bow down to Dada Bhagwan within me.”

Current link for attaining the knowledge of
Self-Realization (Atmagnan)
“I am personally going to impart siddhis (special spiritual
powers) to a few people. After I leave, will there not be a need
for them? People of future generations will need this path, won’t
they?”
~ Dadashri
Param Pujya Dadashri used to go from town to town and
country-to-country to give satsang and impart the knowledge of

the Self as well as knowledge of harmonious worldly interaction
to all who came to see him. In his final days in late 1987, he
graced Dr. Niruben Amin with the siddhis to continue his Work.
After Param Pujya Dadashri left his mortal body on
January 2, 1988, Dr. Niruben continued his Work, traveling
within India to cities and villages; and going abroad visiting all
continents of the world. She was Dadashri’s representative of
Akram Vignan, until March 19, 2006, when she left her mortal
body entrusting all further care of the Work to Shri Deepakbhai
Desai. She was instrumental in expanding the key role of Akram
Vignan as the simple and direct path to Self-realization for modern
times. Hundreds of thousands of spiritual seekers had taken
advantage of this opportunity and are established in the experience
of pure Soul while carrying out their worldly duties. They
experience freedom, here and now while living their daily life.
Shri Deepakbhai Desai had been given the siddhi to
conduct satsang of Akram Vignan by Gnani Purush Dadashri in
presence of Pujya Niruben Amin. Between 1988 and 2006, he
has given satsang nationally and internationally as directed by
Dadashri under the guidance of Dr. Niruben Amin. Now these
satsangs and Gnan Vidhis of Akram Vignan continue in full
force through the medium of Atmagnani Shri Deepakbhai Desai.
Powerful words in scriptures help the seeker in increasing
their desire for liberation and thus they represent the path. The
knowledge of the Self is the final goal of all seekers. Without
the knowledge of the Self there is no liberation. This knowledge
does not exist in books. It exists in the heart of a Gnani. Hence,
the knowledge of the Self can only be acquired by meeting a
Gnani. Through the scientific approach of the Akram Vignan,
even today one can attain Atmagnan, by meeting a living
Atmagnani. Only a lit candle can light another candle!

Note About This Translation
Gnani Purush Ambalal M. Patel, popularly known as
Dadashri or Dada or Dadaji, used to say that it is not possible to
exactly translate his satsang on the Science of Self-Realization
and the art of worldly interaction, into English. Some of the depth
and intent of meaning to be conveyed to the seeker, would be
lost. He stressed the importance of learning Gujarati to precisely
understand all his teachings.
Dadashri did however grant his blessings to convey his
original words to the world through translations in English and
other languages. It was his deepest desire and fervor that the
suffering human beings of the world attain the living freedom of
the wonderful Akram Vignan that expressed within him. He further
stated that a day would come when the world would be in awe of
the phenomenal powers of this science.
This is an humble attempt to present to the world the essence
of the teachings of Dadashri, the Gnani Purush. A lot of care has
been taken to preserve the tone and message of his words. This is
not a literal translation of his words. Many individuals have worked
diligently for this product and we remain deeply thankful to them
all.
This is an elementary introduction to the vast new treasure
of his teachings. Please note that any errors committed in the
translation are entirely those of the translators and for those we
request your pardon.

PREFACE
Anger is a weakness, but people think of it as strength. The
one who does not get angry possesses more inner strength than
the one who gets angry.
A person usually becomes angry when things do not go his
way, when he is misunderstood by another person, or when his
viewpoints clash with another’s viewpoints. We become angry
when we are accused of being wrong, when we think we are
right. Our perception causes us to believe that we are right.
According to the other person, he believes that he is right.
Because we do not know how to reason and because, we have
no foresight or intuition, we become angry.
When we are insulted, we become angry. We become
angry when we incur a loss. In protecting our pride or our greed,
we experience anger. If one is to become free from pride and
greed, he must have awareness (spiritual). Say for instance, your
son-in-law broke your china tea set, would you not control your
temper? If your servant were to do the same thing, should you
not control your temper in this situation as well? Our reactions
vary in different situations (from situation to situation).
Anger can only dissolve if one understands that those who
do wrong by him are merely his nimits, (people instrumental in
delivering the effects of his past karma) and that what he is
experiencing is the result of his karmas from his previous life.
We should be aware of our anger at all times. When
someone is hurt by our anger, we should be remorseful, ask him
or her for forgiveness, and vow never to get angry again. It is
necessary for us to do this. We must do this because the person
we become angry towards will be hurt; he will harbor a grudge
and bind vengeance against us, and therefore, in our next life, we
will have to suffer the consequences.

When parents become angry with their children or when a
guru becomes angry with his disciples, they bind punya (merit
karma). This is because their aim is to improve their children and
disciples respectively. If one were to become angry out of
selfishness, he would then bind paap (bad karma). This is the
teaching of the Enlightened Ones.
Anger, the subject dealt with in this book, is the most
troublesome and overt of all inner human weaknesses. It is
discussed extensively for clear understanding. It is our sincere
hope that the readers will find this helpful in their endeavor to free
themselves from the severe grip of anger.
- Dr. Niruben Amin

ANGER
WHO ACCEPTS THEY ARE WRONG?
Questioner : If someone makes us out to be wrong
even though we think we are right, we become angry with him.
How can we stop from getting angry?
Dadashri : Yes, but only when you are right. Are you
really right? Do you know that you are right?
Questioner : Our soul tells us we are right.
Dadashri : In that situation, you are the judge, the lawyer,
and the culprit. So of course you are going to be right, you will
not allow yourself to be wrong. Just as you think that you are
right, the other person will think that he is right. Do you
understand?
THESE ARE ALL WEAKNESSES
Questioner : Is it not good to feel an aversion towards
injustice? Are we not justified in feeling angry when we clearly
see injustice ?
Dadashri : Anger and hatred are weaknesses. The whole
world has these weaknesses. Do you get angry if someone scolds
you ?
Questioner : Yes, I do.
Dadashri : So is that a weakness or strength?

2

Anger

Questioner : In certain situations it is necessary to
become angry.
Dadashri : No, no. Anger is a weakness. To say that
anger is necessary in certain situations is a worldly notion. People
make such statements because they are not able to get rid of
their anger.
A PERSON IS STRONG WHEN HE REMAINS
UNAFFECTED
Questioner : Would it not be considered cowardly to
remain silent when someone insults you?
Dadashri : Not at all, to bear an insult is a sign of great
strength. If someone were to swear at me right now, I would
not have a single negative thought towards him. That is strength.
Quibbling and quarrelling is weakness. To bear an insult calmly
is a great strength. If a person overcomes an insult just once,
he will acquire the strength to do so hundred times over. Do
you understand? If you are strong, your opponent will become
weak. That is the natural trend. When a weak person harasses
us and we do not do anything in response, it is considered a
great strength.
In actuality the weak should be protected and the strong
should be confronted. In this current time cycle, nobody behaves
in this manner at all. Nowadays, people keep badgering the
weak and run away from the strong. There are very few people
that protect the weak and stand up against the strong. This
whole world keeps hurting the weak. At home, the husband
dominates the wife. If you beat a cow that is tied up, where will
she go? And what if you were to untie the cow and then beat
her? She would either run away or fight back.
A man who, despite being strong, does not harm his
opponents, not even his enemy, is considered a powerful person.
Is it not cowardly when you get angry with someone who gets

Anger

3

angry with you? I am saying that these inner enemies of man,
anger, pride, attachment, and greed are weaknesses. Why would
a person who is strong need to get angry? People, however, try
to control others with their anger. Those who do not use anger
as a weapon have something else. That something else, is sheel
(extraordinary moral character). Sheel in a person subdues even
animals. Lions, tigers, and enemies will all surrender to such a
person.
THE ANGRY MAN IS A WEAKLING
Questioner : But Dada, what should we do when
someone gets angry with us?
Dadashri : They will get angry. Is it under their control?
Their inner machinery is not under their control. This machinery
keeps working any way it can. If it were under their control
they would not let the machine overheat. To become even the
slightest bit angry is to behave like a beast. One becomes
transformed from a human being into a beast. People would not
let such a thing happen, but what can they do when it is out of
the their control?
The world is such, that there is no reason at any given time
for any anger to take place. Even when children do not listen,
there is no reason to become angry. You must handle this situation
by remaining calm. To become angry is a terrible weakness.
Anger is the worst weakness of all. You should be sympathetic
towards the person who becomes angry and understand that he
does not have any control in this matter. You should feel compassion
for the person who has no control over himself.
What does it mean to become angry? When one becomes
angry, it is like setting fire to oneself and then setting others on
fire. Once the match is struck, it bursts into flames, destroying all
around. So if getting angry were under one’s control, one would
not get angry. Who likes to burn? If someone tells me that anger

4

Anger

is necessary in this world, I would respond by telling him that
there is never a reason for anger. Anger is a weakness and that
is why it happens spontaneously. God has called it a weakness.
God has said that a real man is the one who has no weakness
of ego, anger, greed, or attachment whatsoever. These men that
you see around you are weaklings, because they have no control
over their anger and they do not know how to deal with it.
Anger, ego, attachment, and greed are all obvious weaknesses.
Can you not feel your body tremble when you get angry?
Questioner : Even the body is saying that anger is not
good.
Dadashri : Yes, even the body tells us that it is wrong
when it trembles. So, one should consider anger to be a great
weakness.
PERSONALITY WITHOUT WEAKNESS OF ANGER
Questioner : If we see a man beating a child, should we
not voice our anger at him?
Dadashri : He will not stop the beating even if you do
get angry. Why would you get angry with him? He may beat
you too. Talk to him calmly and explain to him that it is a
weakness to react in anger.
Questioner : Then should we let him continue to beat
the child ?
Dadashri : No, but you should ask him why he is beating
the child. Try to make him understand. If you get angry with him,
then this anger is your weakness. First and foremost, you should
not carry the weakness within you. Those that do not have any
weaknesses, have impressive personalities. When such people
utter even a single word, everyone will listen to them readily.
Questioner : Perhaps they may not.
Dadashri : They would not listen to you because you

Anger

5

are weak and lack personality. There should not be any
weakness. One should have good conduct. One must have a
flawless personality. Even thugs will run away at the sight of
such a person. No one will run away from an angry person. On
the contrary they may even beat him up. The whole world
strikes at the weak.
When can one acquire such a personality? He will acquire
such a personality when he understands the spiritual science of
the Self. In this world, the relative knowledge is forgotten,
whereas the science of the Self remains with you.
FROST IS MORE DEADLY THAN HEAT
Dadashri : When there is frost or an ice storm, it gets so
cold that it burns the grass, the trees, and all the crops. Why
do you think everything burns when it gets cold?
Questioner : Everything burns because of extreme cold.
Dadashri : Yes, so if you live calmly and remain cool,
you will become more effective.
DIGNITY WHERE ANGER CEASES
Questioner : But Dada, is it not a weakness to be too
calm?
Dadashri : We have to remain within limits. That is called
normality. “Below normal is the fever, above normal is the fever,
and ninety-eight degrees is the normal”. Therefore only normality
is required.
People are more fearful of those who do not get angry as
opposed to those who do. Why is that so? It is because one
develops inner strength when anger ceases. This is the law of
nature. Otherwise, there would be no one to protect such people.
People use anger as a form of protection. In ignorance (ignorance
of one’s real Self), one’s protection is through anger.

6

Anger

IRRITABLE PEOPLE ALWAYS LOSE
Questioner : Reasonable annoyance or reasonable anger,
is it not good?
Dadashri : What do people call that? Even children will
say, “He is always cranky!” It is foolish to become irritated.
Irritation is considered a weakness. If we ask the children what
their father is like, they would say that he is a very cranky
person. Does this not discredit the father’s reputation?
If you ask a child who in his family he likes best, he would
say that he likes his mother the most because she does not get
angry. The father undoubtedly comes last on his list because the
father always gets angry. I would remind the child that it is his
father who provides everything for him, so is not the father his
favorite? And the child would shake his head. Now tell me, we
work hard, we feed them, we bring home the money and give it
to them, and yet even then we come last.
ANGER IS BLINDNESS
Questioner : What is the main reason behind a man’s
anger ?
Dadashri : He loses sight. When one does not see the
wall, he bumps into it. In the same way, he cannot see from
within, which is why anger occurs. When he cannot see what
lies ahead of him, anger overcomes him.
ANGER OCCURS WHERE THERE IS LACK OF
INSIGHT
When does anger take place? It is when one’s vision
(darshan) becomes obscured, and his knowledge (gnan) is
obstructed, that his anger arises. The same happens when a
person is overcome with pride.
Questioner : Please illustrate this point with an example.
Dadashri : Do people not ask you why you get angry?

Anger

7

You would tell them that it was because you could not think
clearly. Yes it is when people cannot think clearly that they get
angry. Would they get angry if they were able to think? How
are you rewarded when you get angry? First the sparks set you
on fire and then you burn others.
THE FIRE OF ANGER BURNS ONESELF AND
THEN OTHERS
Anger is like putting a lighted match to one’s own home.
Anger is setting fire to one’s own home, which is filled with hay.
First his own house burns and then the neighbor’s house.
What happens when a single match is thrown onto a
haystack in a field?
Questioner : It will burn.
Dadashri : It is the same with anger. Whatever he had
earned in two years, he will destroy in an instant by getting
angry. Anger is a live fire. The person himself will not realize
that he has destroyed everything, because the damage is not
visible on the outside, but everything from within is destroyed.
Part of whatever he has accumulated for the next life is expended.
What happens if more is exhausted? As a human, he eats bread,
but in his next life, as an animal, he will have to eat grass.
No man in this world can conquer anger. Anger has two
parts. One part comes as discord and the other as restlessness.
Discord is apparent to others and restlessness remains within,
unseen by others. It is the discord part of anger that one is able
to overcome. However, as one part is suppressed, the other
part increases. When one claims to have conquered his anger,
his pride increases. In reality, anger cannot be completely
conquered. Perhaps one can say that he has conquered the
visible anger, discord.
SULKING IS ANGER
When a person sulks in anger, it is really anger itself. For

8

Anger

example, if a husband and wife quarrel intensely in the night, so
much anger is generated that they both lay awake restless, the
entire night. In the morning the wife serves him tea by banging
the teacup. The husband will then realize that she is still sulking.
This is called anger. The sulking can last for any period of time.
For some it may even be life-long. Sometimes anger between
a father and son will create such enmity between them that
neither of them will want to see each other’s face. The sulking
is apparent from the disgruntled look on one’s face.
Sulking can be such that, if someone were to insult me
fifteen years ago, and I encounter him again today, the moment
I lay eyes on him, I will remember everything from the past.
That is taanton (the lingering connection from the past event).
Ordinarily people’s sulking never goes away. Even renowned
ascetics and monks sulk. If you were to provoke them and
challenge their authority, they would not speak to you for weeks.
This is called taanton.
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KRODH (ANGER) AND
GUSSO (ANNOYANCE)
Questioner : Dada what is the difference between
annoyance and anger?
Dadashri : Anger is associated with ego. When
annoyance and ego are combined, they result in anger. When a
father gets annoyed with his children, it is not called anger,
because it is not associated with the ego. Anger binds paap
(bad karma), but the annoyance of a father will bind punyas
(positive karma), because he is thinking about the welfare of his
children. Anger is accompanied by the ego. When you get
annoyed, do you feel bad from within?
There are two kinds of anger, pride, attachment and greed
(krodh, maan, maya, lobh).
One kind you can divert – nivarya. If you get angry with

Anger

9

someone then from within you divert that anger and calm it
down. If one were able to reach this stage, his worldly
interactions would become very pleasant.
The other kind of anger is one that cannot be diverted
anivarya. One tries very hard to prevent it, but from within the
explosion still occurs. Such anger is anivarya. This anger injures
the person himself, as well as others.
God has allowed a certain level of anger for the sadhus
(sages, monks) so that they may uphold the austerity of their
conduct, as long as it does not hurt anyone. ‘My anger can hurt
only me and not anyone else.’ This much anger has been
permitted.
RECOGNIZE THE KNOWER
Questioner : We all know that anger is bad, but still…
Dadashri : It is like this : The one, who is angry, is not
aware of the anger. The one, who is greedy, is not aware of his
greed and the one who is arrogant is not aware of his pride.
The ‘knower’ is completely separate from all of these
weaknesses. People inquire why weaknesses still occur even
when they are aware of their weakness. Now, who is it that
says ‘I know’? They do not know the answer to this. They are
not aware of who the ‘knower’ is. This is what one must discover.
If one can unearth the ‘knower,’ then all of his weaknesses will
dissipate. It can only be called true knowledge, when all the
weaknesses are destroyed.
KNOW THE CORRECT SOLUTION JUST ONCE
Questioner : I still become angry even though I know
that it is wrong to become angry. What is the solution?
Dadashri : Who is it that knows? If you had the real
knowledge just once, there would be no anger. But because
you still become angry, it means that you do not know. There
is ego in your saying that you know.

10

Anger

Questioner : After getting angry I realize that I should
not get angry.
Dadashri : No, but after you know who the knower is,
there would be no anger. Let’s say there are two identical
bottles standing side by side, and you are told that one has
medicine in it and the other has poison in it. Now if you mistake
one for the other, then you can conclude that you did not know.
If you do not mistake the one for the other, then you can say
that you do know. This would apply to anger as well. The
reason you become angry is because you do not know. You are
merely going around with ego when you say that you know. In
darkness you are likely to bump into things, but when there is
light and you can see clearly, you will not have any accidents.
When we confuse the darkness with light, it is our own mistake.
So come and sit in the Satsang with me and acquire the real
knowledge. Then only will anger, pride, attachment, and greed
go away.
Questioner : But everyone gets angry.
Dadashri : Ask this gentleman. He is saying no.
Questioner : There will be no anger after coming to
satsang.
Dadashri : What kind of medicine do you think he took?
It is a medicine that removes the root cause of anger.
ONLY THROUGH RIGHT UNDERSTANDING
Questioner : I get angry with people that are close to
me. The other person may be right according to his viewpoint,
but from my viewpoint I become very angry. What is the reason
for my anger?
Dadashri : If you are walking along and a stone from a
building falls on your head and hurts you, will you get angry?
Questioner : No, because it happened spontaneously.

Anger

11

Dadashri : No, but why do you not get angry in this
situation? It is because you do not see anybody there. Who will
you get angry with?
Questioner : But no one has thrown the stone.
Dadashri : And if you were to go out now and a little
boy throws a stone at you, you will get angry with him. Why?
Because you believe that the boy threw the stone at you.
However, if a stone rolls down a hillside and hits you, you will
look around but you will not get angry.
You become angry because in your mind you feel that a
person is responsible. No one is able to hurt another person
knowingly. Whether a boy throws a stone at you or whether a
stone accidentally falls on you, it is essentially the same thing. It
is an illusion that makes you perceive that someone is responsible
for it. In this world, no man has the independent power over
even his own bowel movements.
We do have control over anger. When we realize that no
one has thrown the stone that falls from the hillside, we do not
get angry. And when you say, “Anger overcomes me,” it really
does not. If it did, then why do you not react in the same way
when a stone fall on you? Why don’t you get angry when a
policeman tells you off, yet you get angry with your wife, with
the children, with the neighbors, and with those working under
you? Why don’t you get angry with your boss? Anger does not
just happen to people. People get angry because they want to
have their own way.
Questioner : How can one control it?
Dadashri : The control is present. Recognize that the
person who throws the stone at you is merely your nimit
(someone instrumental) who is bringing to you, the effects of
your past karma. When you see a stone falling from a hill, your
anger does not arise. In the same manner, here too you should

12

Anger

exercise control, because everything is just like the hill.
If a car is coming head-on at you, will you get angry or
will you move out of the way? Would you crash with the car?
You are aware of the consequences. But when you get angry,
the internal destruction is much greater. The external destruction
is obvious to you, but you are not aware of the internal
destruction. This is the only difference.
RESULTS CHANGE WHEN CAUSES CHANGE
Someone asked me why, for countless lives, man has
tried to get rid of anger and has not succeeded. I told him that
perhaps he did not have the right solution. He told me that the
solutions given in the scriptures, which he himself was following,
did not eradicate his anger. I told him that the solution has to
be exact and correct. Trying to find a solution to stop the anger
is foolishness because anger is a result. It is just like the results
of an examination. The result cannot be changed. It is the cause
which one needs to change.
People try to suppress anger, but it is futile, and in doing
so one may even become insane. Besides, anger is not something
that one can rid himself of. A person told me that he has been
successful in suppressing his anger to some degree. However,
you cannot say that it is suppressed, while it still remains inside.
When he asked me for a solution, I told him to make note of
those circumstances and those people that made him angry and
to make note of those that did not. He also was to make note
of when he did not get angry even though the other person did
something wrong. There are circumstances in which we get
angry even though the other person does the right thing. What
is the reason behind this?
Questioner : Is it because a granthi (a knot of opinion)
has formed in our mind for that person?
Dadashri : Yes, numerous opinions have been formed.

Anger

13

What should one do to disentangle from those opinions? The
examination has already been given. You will get angry with that
person as many times as you were meant to. But what must you
do from now on? You should not allow yourself to become
prejudiced towards the person with whom you get angry. You
should change your opinion of him. It is because of the account
of your prarabdh (fate, past karma, destiny) that this person is
behaving in such a manner with you. Whatever that person
does, it is because of the result of your own karma. You should
change your opinion about him. If you change your opinion of
him, you will no longer get angry with him. The effect from the
past will remain for some time. That effect will come, give its
results and then it will cease altogether.
This is a very subtle point, which people have failed to
discover. There is a solution for everything. All matters in this
world can never be without a solution. People are trying to
destroy only the results. The solution to anger, pride, attachment,
and greed, is to destroy their causes and leave the results alone.
If one does not have the awareness in the first place, then how
will he find the solution?
Questioner : Please explain again how to destroy the
causes.
Dadashri : If I get angry with this gentleman, I decide
that my anger towards him is the result of me seeing faults in him
previously. Now whatever wrong he does, as long as I do not
let it affect my mind, the anger towards him will subside. Some
of it will still come as a result of the past, but no more will come
in the future.
Questioner : Does anger stem from looking at others’
faults?
Dadashri : Yes. Even while seeing their faults, you should
be aware that it is wrong and it is a result. Once this process
of seeing faults in others ceases, anger will cease.

14

Anger

EGO IS AT THE ROOTS OF ANGER
Some people ask how they can get rid of their anger.
When they tell me that they try to suppress it, I ask them
whether they are trying to suppress it before or after they
understand it. I tell them that they must understand anger first,
because anger and peace coexist. If one fails to understand
anger and tries to suppress it, he may be suppressing peace
instead, so peace will die. Therefore, anger is not something
that one can suppress. One has to understand that anger is ego.
Analyze the ego that causes the anger.
If this child breaks something valuable and we get angry,
what kind of ego is it? It is the kind of ego that tells us that we
have incurred a loss from the breakage. Here the ego is of
profit and loss. We have to think about how we will go about
destroying this kind of ego. Otherwise by harboring the ego, the
anger will continue. Anger and greed at their very core, are
really only ego.
WITH WHAT UNDERSTANDING IS ONE TO
PACIFY ANGER?
Anger itself is the ego. One must examine why this is so.
Once we look into it, we will be able to grasp it. If we get angry
when something breaks, we have to question why the anger
occurs. The answer would be that the breakage means a loss.
It is because of the loss that we feel angry. If one thinks deeply
about the ego and the anger, the very process of thinking will
wash away his ego. There are circumstances that are unavoidable.
The head of the household will scold his servant for breaking
things, but he would remain silent if his son-in-law were to do
the same. He remains silent with the people he considers
important and he yells at the servant, whom he considers to be
inferior. This is egoism. Do people not become silent in the
presence of their superiors? If Dada were to break something,
not even a single thought would cross their minds, but if the

Anger

15

servant were to break something, then what? Even if people
understood with their buddhi (intellect), it would suffice! If the
buddhi had been developed and molded with understanding,
then there would be no arguments. Will the scolding help restore
the damage? It only gives one a little satisfaction. Moreover,
there is bickering and mental stress involved in it.
In the above situation, one has not only incurred a loss
from the broken cups, but also a loss from inner restless has
been created. Thirdly, a loss has occurred because of hostility
created towards the servant. The servant thinks that he is being
cruelly treated because he is poor. He will harbor hostility and
will bind revenge karma for next life. God has said that one
should not bind vengeance with anyone. Where possible, bind
love but do not bind hostility. If you bind love, then that love
itself will destroy the hostility. Love overcomes hatred. Vengeance
will breed vengeance and it will continue to do so forever.
Vengeance is the reason for the endless wanderings life after
life. Why do these human beings wander endlessly?
What obstacles arise? Where do the obstructions arise?
We should destroy them. It is because of one’s shortsightedness
that he encounters obstructions. The Gnani Purush gives you the
‘long-sight’ that will enable you to see things exactly the way
they are.
WHEN ONE GETS ANGRY WITH CHILDREN…
Questioner : What should I do when I become angry
with my child ?
Dadashri : Anger happens because of lack of
understanding. If you ask your child how he feels when you get
angry, he will tell you that it hurts him. He is hurt and you are
too. Is there a need to get angry with the child? If it benefited
him, then you could continue with it, but if the consequences are
bad, then what is the point of being angry ?

16

Anger

Questioner : If we didn’t get angry then they wouldn’t
listen to us, and they wouldn’t eat.
Dadashri : So you would intimidate them so that they
would listen to you?
JUST LOOK AT THE SUBTLETY OF THE
ENLIGHTENED ONES
People will think that a father is worthless because he
displays so much anger towards his child. But what sort of
justice would this be according to nature? According to nature’s
law, the father is binding punya. Why is it considered a punya
in spite of his anger? It is because he is subjecting himself to
turmoil for the benefit of his child. He binds punya because he
takes on the strife for the happiness of his child. Generally all
forms of anger will bind paap, except where one becomes
angry and sacrifices his own happiness for the happiness of his
child or his disciple. Here, punya is bound. People will look
upon him with disgust and disapproval. The justice of nature is
different. There is no hinsak bhaav (intention to hurt) when you
become angry with your sons or your daughters, but there is
hinsak bhaav everywhere else. His taanto (lingering of
annoyance and anger) however, may remain and if so, whenever
he sets eyes on his child, the conflicts will arise inside him.
Now if neither the intent to hurt nor the lingering of
annoyance were present in the anger, one would attain liberation.
If just the hinsak bhaav is missing, but the taanto is still there,
then one would bind punya. Just look at the intricate details of
discovery of The Lord.
DESPITE ANGER ONE BINDS PUNYA
God tells us that any anger that is done for the sake of
others and for the benefit of a greater good, will bind punya.
Now in the Kramic path (the traditional step by step path
to Self-Realization), religious disciples live under the fear of

Anger

17

being reprimanded by their guru. The guru’s eyes become red
with anger. Yet, because he becomes angry for the welfare of
his disciples, the guru binds punya. Can you imagine how much
suffering they have to endure? How is one ever going to be
liberated? Liberation is not easy. Only on a rare occasion does
one attain something like AkramVignan.
ANGER IS A KIND OF A SIGNAL
People would say that the man that gets angry with his
children is the offender and that he is the one that binds paap,
but God does not say that. God would say that he is the offender
if as a father he fails to get angry with his child. Is it good to
get angry? No, but it was necessary at the time because if he
did not, his son would have strayed in the wrong direction.
Consequently, anger is a red signal, nothing else. If the father
had not appeared intimidating and had not become angry, he
would have lost his son to the path of vice.
People have no idea that anger is a red flag. It is important
for one to understand when and for how long this flag has to
be utilized.
FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE MEDITATION
If you become angry with your son, your bhaav (intention)
should be, ‘This should not happen.’ This means that you have
changed negative meditation into positive meditation. Although
you were angry, the result turns positive internally because you
have changed your true inner intent.
Questioner : Is it because of the bhaav : ‘It should not
be this way?’
Dadashri : There is no intent to hurt behind it. It is
impossible to have anger without the intent to hurt. Amongst
all the different situations where anger occurs, it only binds
punya when it is directed towards one’s children, one’s
friends, and one’s wife, if the intent to hurt is absent. The

18

Anger

reason is clearly visible when one looks at his aim behind
his anger.
Even anger has been divided. It is a different anger when
you get angry with your son when he is not paying attention to
the business. God has said that when a father gets angry with
his son for stealing money and other misdeeds, the father will
bind punya.
THE WAY MUSLIMS DEAL WITH ANGER
Questioner : We take out our anger on the wife when
we cannot get angry with the secretary or the nurses at the
hospital. She gets the worst part of it.
Dadashri : I tell people in satsang that when some men
are reprimanded by their superiors, they vent their anger on
their wives instead. So then I rebuke them and ask them why
they are taking it out on their poor wives. I ask them why they
do not fight with the person that scolds them instead of fighting
with their wives.
A Muslim friend of mine invited me to his home, so one
day I went with him. He only had two rooms in his house. I
asked him how he managed to live in such a confined space. I
asked him if his wife ever bothered him. He said that sometimes
his wife would get angry but he would not. If they both were
to get angry at each other, how would they be able to sleep in
the same room? And furthermore, he would not get even a
decent cup of tea in the morning. He told me that he was happy
to be with his wife, so how could he get angry with her. And
when she got angry with him, he would pacify her by sweettalking her. He said that he would fight outside the home, but
never in the home.
But our men (Hindus) on the other hand, would come
home after receiving a mental thrashing outside and pass it on
their wives.

Anger

19

All day long they are angry. Even the cows and buffaloes
are better; at least they do not get angry. Life should be peaceful!
There should be no weakness in our lives. Anger takes place
all too often.
Did you come here by car? What would happen if the
car got angry on the way here?
Questioner : Then it would be impossible to come here.
Dadashri : When you get angry with your wife, how do
you think she copes?
Dadashri : (To the wife) You don’t get angry do you?
Questioner : Sometimes it happens.
Dadashri : What’s the use of you both getting angry?
Questioner : Should there not be some anger between
a man and wife?
Dadashri : No. There is no such rule. There should be
harmony between a husband and wife. If they hurt each other
they are not husband and wife. There is never any heartache
where there is true friendship, and this is considered the greatest
of all friendships. Others have brainwashed you into thinking
that this is the rule because it happens to them as well. There
should not be any hurt between a husband and wife. It may
happen in other relationships.
PUNISHMENT FOR OBSTINACY
Questioner : When we have conflicting opinions with
our friends or with our family or when things do not go our way,
we get angry. Why do we become angry? And what should we
do about it?
Dadashri : Why do you even think about having your
own way? What would happen if everyone did as they pleased?
Instead you should think what would happen if everyone around
you were stubborn and unyielding. You should never try to

20

Anger

make things go your way. If you do not have any expectations,
you will not go wrong. Anyone with expectations can be stubborn
if he wants to. This is how you should look at it.
Questioner : No matter how hard we try to remain silent,
what should we do when the men get angry?
Dadashri : If you want to start a quarrel, then you should
also get angry. And if not, then you should just remain silent.
What use is anger to you? The person himself does not
get angry. Anger is the effect of a “mechanical adjustment,”
which is why he later regrets it and wishes it never happened.
Questioner : What should I do to calm him?
Dadashri : When a machine gets too hot, you must leave
it alone for a while and in a short time it will cool down. But
if you keep meddling with it, you will get burnt.
Questioner : My husband and I get into terrible
arguments and we also say hurtful things to each other. What
should I do?
Dadashri : Is he the one who gets angry or is it you?
Questioner : Sometimes I do.
Dadashri : Then you should scold yourself from within.
Ask yourself why you are getting angry when you know that
you will suffer the consequences. Do pratikraman (the act of
asking for forgiveness), and all your faults will come to an end.
Otherwise you will have to suffer the same pain that you are
inflicting. You will calm things down a little with pratikraman.
THIS IS CRUDE BEHAVIOR
Questioner : When we get angry we start using abusive
language. How can we improve ourselves?
Dadashri : This happens because one does not have any
control. In order to have some control one should first understand

Anger

21

how he feels when someone gets angry with him. How does he
tolerate such behavior when it is directed towards him? Treat
others the way you would like to be treated.
If someone uses abusive language towards you and it
does not bother you or depress you, it is a different matter. You
should stop it altogether. One must never use abusive language.
Swearing is crude behavior, unbecoming of any human being.
PRATIKRAMAN : THE REAL PATH TO LIBERATION
At one time people were taught to have compassion,
practice fairness and forgiveness, but nowadays how can they
have these qualities when they keep getting angry?
I would tell these people that whenever they get angry,
they should repent from within. They should know the weakness
within them, which prompts their anger. They should accept
their mistake and feel remorse. If they have a guru, they should
seek help from him. They should make a firm resolve to never
let their weakness overcome them again. They should not defend
their anger and they should do pratikraman for it. They should
make a note of when, where, and with whom they became
angry during the day and they should do pratikraman for it.
What should one do in pratikraman? If one’s anger hurts
another person, he must recall the Soul within that person and
ask to be forgiven. He should ask forgiveness for his actions
and vow never to do it again. Aalochana is confession of your
mistake. When you confess your mistakes to me, you are doing
aalochana.
ASK FOR FORGIVENESS INTERNALLY
Questioner : Dada, sometimes when we do pratikraman
and repent for a mistake for getting angry with someone, we
feel anguish within. Yet, we do not have the courage to ask for
forgiveness face to face, from the person.

22

Anger

Dadashri : You need not ask for forgiveness in that way,
otherwise the other person might misuse it. He may think that
he has put you in your place. Just ask for forgiveness internally,
by recalling the Soul within that person. There are only a handful
of people who would forgive you before you even ask for their
forgiveness. Such nobility is rare these days.
SINCERE PRATIKRAMAN YIELDS IMMEDIATE
RESULTS
Questioner : Sometimes I become so angry that I will
say something and then keep quiet, but I am in turmoil from
within and this lingers on. Does this call for more than one
pratikraman?
Dadashri : If you do pratikraman two or three times
wholeheartedly and with resolve never to repeat the mistake,
then everything is over with. Pray to the Soul within that person
and confess that you became very angry and hurt him and that
you are now asking for forgiveness for your actions.
FAULTS END ULTIMATELY
Questioner : The excitement stirred up through
atikraman (aggression involving anger, pride, attachment,
greed) is calmed down with pratikraman.
Dadashri : Yes, it does indeed calm down. With ‘sticky
files’ (Dadashri’s term for those with whom you have great
attachment or abhorrence due to past life karma) you have to
do more than five thousand pratikramans or so before things
are squared away. Although you may not vent your anger when
you become frustrated, if you do not do pratikraman, the ‘stain’
will not be erased. With pratikraman, everything is cleared up.
If you do atikraman, then you must do pratikraman.
Questioner : What if you get angry with someone and
you immediately ask for forgiveness on the spot ?

Anger

23

Dadashri : After acquiring Gnan, when you get angry,
there is no problem, as long as you ask for forgiveness, because
doing pratikraman will set you free. And if you cannot directly
ask for forgiveness from that person, you should do it internally
and this will also set you free.
Questioner : You mean in front of everyone?
Dadashri : It is fine if you cannot directly ask for
forgiveness and you do it internally. These faults are lifeless and
in the form of ‘discharge’ (Dadashri’s term for the dissipation of
effects of previous causes. The term ‘discharge’ applies only for
those who have been graced with his separation from cause and
effects of karma, in the Gnan Vidhi). A ‘discharge’ fault means
that it is non-living, which means that the consequences will be
minimal.
THE SENSE OF DOERSHIP SUSTAINS ANGER
You are not the one making things happen. It is the
kashayas, the weaknesses within you of anger, pride, attachment,
and greed that run everything. Only the rule of these kashayas
prevails. When you acquire the knowledge of your real Self,
these kashayas leave. When one gets angry, he feels remorse
but of what use is it if he does not know how to do pratikraman?
One is freed when he knows how to do pratikraman.
How long can these kashayas last? The kashayas will
remain as long as one believes; ‘I am Chandulal.’ This belief
gives support to the sense that the kashayas are his, ‘I am
angry, I am unhappy etc.’
It is when one attains the awareness, ‘I am pure Self’ that
the sense of ‘I am Chandulal’ is broken and the kashayas are
destroyed. Without this awareness all efforts to remove kashayas,
in fact perpetuate them. When one’s anger is controlled through
his ego, the ego increases and when greed is overcome with the
ego, the ego increases.

24

Anger

WHERE THE ANGER IS CONTROLLED, THE
PRIDE INCREASES.
A sadhu told me that he had completely eradicated his
anger through his spiritual effort. The anger was in fact
suppressed. I told him that he had instead created a monster by
the name of pride (maan). This monster thrives because he is
the offspring of ignorance of the Self (maya). The sons of
ignorance cannot be killed. One can get rid of them if he has
a solution. This solution is Self-realization.
ANGER AND DECEIT ARE FALSE PROTECTORS
Anger and deceit give protection to pride and greed. The
protector of greed is deceit and the protector of pride is anger.
Sometimes deceit also plays a role in protecting pride. Sometimes
anger also plays a role in protecting greed.
Through anger they practice greed. A greedy person
rarely gets angry, and when he does, we should understand
that he is probably experiencing some difficulty related to his
greed. Moreover, greedy people do not care what others say
or think as long as they make money. They do not care even
if they are insulted. They are like this because deceit will
protect them. Deceit is their ignorance and is part of their
nature. Thus deceit and anger are protectors of internal
weaknesses.
One gets angry when his pride is wounded. Anger is
easily detected and therefore, is easy to remove as compared
to deceit, which deceives even the owner. Anger is the first of
the kashayas to go. Anger is like ammunition, and wherever
there is ammunition, there is an army ready to fight. Once the
ammunition is depleted, why would the army still fight? Everyone
would simply run away. No one will stick around.
THE NATURE OF ANGER
Anger represents volatile atoms. If a barrel containing

Anger

25

gunpowder ignites, it would start an explosion. When all the
gunpowder is finished, the barrel becomes inactive again. That
is how it is with anger. The volatile atoms of anger will ignite
according to the law of vyavasthit (Scientific circumstantial
evidence), and will explode in every direction. It is not called
anger (krodh) if no taanto (link of anger) remains. It is called
anger only when there is taanto associated with it. It is called
anger when there is a feeling of burning inside. When this happens,
the burning continues and it affects others also. This burning if
manifested outwardly, is called kadhapo, and if one experiences
internal burning and restlessness, it is called ajampo. Sulking
occurs in both.
TO ENDURE OR RETAIN A GRUDGE IS ANGER
If people do not use angry words, then it does not hurt
anyone. It is not just the anger that is expressed outwardly that
constitutes anger, but also the smoldering one feels within.
Tolerance is really twice the anger. Tolerance means to suppress
continually. One will realize this when the spring of coil suppressed
anger rebounds one day. Why should one have to endure this?
One merely has to bring about a solution through Gnan.
ANGER IS VIOLENCE
The intellect makes one emotional and Gnan keeps him
calm. What would happen if a train running smoothly becomes
emotional?
Questioner : An accident would occur.
Dadashri : If it does not stay upright on the track, there
will be an accident. Similarly, when a man becomes emotional,
so many living organisms within him are killed. The moment
anger arises, millions of lives are destroyed, but even then people
maintain that they practice non-violence (ahinsa or ahimsa).
People need to be aware that they are doing great violence
when they become emotional and get angry.

26

Anger

THE WAY TO CONQUER ANGER
The external activities of the world : the thoughts, speech,
and acts of human beings do not change. However, if one
changes his bhaav (deep inner intention), then it is enough.
People say they want to stop their anger. One cannot
stop it immediately. Firstly, he must recognize what anger is and
the causes behind it are. How is it born and who are its parents?
All this has to be determined even before anger is understood.
LIBERATION AT THE HANDS OF THE LIBERATED
Do you want to be rid of your weaknesses? Tell me what
you want to get rid of. Make a list. Are you bound by anger,
pride, attachment, and greed?
Questioner : Yes.
Dadashri : How can a person who is bound, free himself?
How can someone whose arms and legs are tied up tightly
become free?
Questioner : He has to get help from someone.
Dadashri : Should he seek the help of someone who
himself is tied up?
Questioner : He should get help from someone who is
free to help.
Dadashri : Yes, you have to ask help from a person
who is free.
THE FOOD OF ANGER, PRIDE, ATTACHMENT
AND GREED
There are many people who have some awareness and
insight into their anger. They say that they do not like the anger
that develops within them. Many on the other hand believe that
unless they get angry, they will not accomplish anything.

Anger

27

Anger, attachment, pride and greed always harm the
owner. People do not understand this. If you were to starve
them for three years, they (kashayas) would run away. What
is the nourishment for these weaknesses? How can you starve
them if you do not know what they thrive on? It is your lack
of understanding that provides sustenance for them. How do
they survive and carry on life after life? Stop feeding them.
People do not think along these lines and instead forcefully try
to subdue them. These four weaknesses will not go away
easily.
An acharya (spiritual head) scolds his disciple with anger.
If a person asks the acharya why he is scolding his disciple, and
he replies that the disciple needed to be told off, then by making
such a statement, he has fed his anger. This support for his
anger is its food.
If anger, pride, attachment, and greed are not fed for
three years, they will leave. This is because each has its specific
diet, which people provide everyday and so they grow healthy
and strong.
When a man smacks his child in anger, his wife will rebuke
him for doing so. If he tells her that the child deserved it, then
he would be feeding his anger. In making such statements, people
support their weaknesses.
I have never given protection to anger, pride, attachment,
and greed. If I happen to get angry and someone asks me why,
I would tell him that it is wrong to get angry and that it occurred
because of my weakness. In this way, I do not protect it. But
other people do.
If a sadhu (an ascetic) happens to be using snuff and we
ask why a man of his status should have such an addiction, he
will strengthen his addiction when he says that there is no harm
in using snuff.

28

Anger

Out of these four, anger, pride, attachment and greed, a
person may favor one over the others and will therefore
strengthen it by siding with it.
OVERT KARMA : SUBTLE KARMA
I will explain to you what overt (sthool) karma is. Do
you ever become angry even though you do not want to be
angry?
Questioner : Yes.
Dadashri : You experience the consequences of your
anger right away. People will say that you are foul tempered.
Someone may even slap you, which means that you will suffer
the consequences through being disgraced in some way or
another. Anger is sthool karma. When you get angry, if you
have the internal bhaav that anger is necessary, then this bhaav
will be your account of anger for your next life. If however,
your bhaav today is that you should not get angry and you
have made a decision that you do not want any part of anger,
even though it still occurs, you will not have bound anger for
the next life. You will be punished for the anger, which occurs
as sthool karma in this life, but even then it will not bind you
in the next life. This is because in the subtle (sookshma) karma
your resolve (nischaya) is not to get angry.
On the other hand, if a person does not get angry with
anyone, but has the belief that one should use anger to sort
people out, then in his next life he will be a very angry man.
Therefore, the external anger represents sthool karma and the
internal bhaav is the sookshma karma. Sthool karma do not
bind new karma. They represent an effect. That is why I have
presented this science to you in a different light. Until now,
people have been led to believe that karmas are bound through
sthool karma, and that is why they live in fear.

Anger

29

KASHAYAS FLEE WITH THE SCIENCE OF
SEPARATION
Questioner : Is there any prerequisite needed to conquer
these four kashayas?
Dadashri : When these four kashayas of anger, pride,
attachment, and greed leave, one becomes a God.
God said that when one gets angry with his blood relatives,
their minds become estranged. This estranged state will prevail
for years, or throughout their lives. Such anger is wrong.
Ultimately it is a useless anger. This type of anger binds one for
infinite lives. Even greed, pride, and attachment will do the
same. They are very difficult. It is only after they leave, that one
attains bliss.
One will be rid of these kashayas, if he listens to the
Enlightened One. The Enlightened One is the Gnani Purush,
who has the knowledge of the Soul and can give you this
knowledge.
The only other way out from these kashayas is to acquire
the Science of Separation. Then all these kashayas will leave.
This is the wonder of this time cycle. This is called Akram
Vignan.
